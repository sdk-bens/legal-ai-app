# Legal-AI-App


Welcome to the NLP Web Application project! This repository contains the code for developing a web application that serves as both the front end and back end for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that we have been working on recently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a user-friendly interface for our NLP project, allowing users to interact with NLP models and algorithms. The application will perform various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this web application on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- FastAPI
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge (for frontend customization)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sdk-bens/AI-Legal-Assistant-Web.git <-- This is Deprecated
   ```
   Use this:
   
```bash
   git clone https://username:token@github.com/sdk-bens/AI-Legal-Assistant-Web.git

```


3. Create a virtual environment (recommended).

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment.

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required Python packages.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

- Modify the configuration files (`config.py`) to set up any API keys, database connections, or other environment-specific settings.

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask development server.

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `app/`: Contains the Flask application code.
- `static/`: Stores static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images for the frontend.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for rendering web pages.
- `config.py`: Configuration file for application settings.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are currently not accepted as it is a closed-source application.
